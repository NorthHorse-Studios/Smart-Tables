# What are smart tables?
Smart tables are tables that inherit certain functionalities from metatables in order to recursively search for a given index at indexation, this allows developers to save a lot of time creating iteration functionalities or even getting to the proper key/index manually. **So why should you use it?** As mentioned, it recursively searches the full table and returns the first matching key/index it can find with a time difference  from 0 to 0.0003 (or sometimes even faster than a normal indexation). This can be considered nothing in terms of a performance drop.
